# ng-woopsa
This is the angular Woopsa module. To find out more about Woopsa and get the C# / Embedded C or jQuery implementation, go to http://www.woopsa.org!

Woopsa is a protocol that's simple, lightweight, free, open-source, web and object-oriented, publish-subscribe, real-time capable and Industry 4.0 ready. It contributes to the revolution of the Internet of Things.

Woopsa allows you to share the complete object model of your application in a way that's similar to OPC-UA. It's based on rock-solid foundations such as HTTP and JSON, which makes it work on the web out-of-the-box. Our mission is to get Woopsa on as many platforms as possible. Today, C# and JavaScript implementations exist, but there are much more to come!

As a node module, Woopsa is very useful if you wish to quickly create a RESTful API. 

On the server-side, just give Woopsa any JavaScript object with properties and functions, and the library will create a RESTful API allowing you to read/write properties and call functions, automagically!
